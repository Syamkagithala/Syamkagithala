The Power of Compound Interest: Your Money’s Best Friend

Imagine you invest ₹10,000 today in a savings account with a 5% annual interest rate. At first glance, it seems modest. But here’s where the magic of compound interest kicks in. After one year, you’ll earn ₹500 in interest, bringing your total to ₹10,500.

In the second year, you earn interest on the new total, not just your initial investment. By year five, you’ll have about ₹12,762. Over 30 years, that initial ₹10,000 could grow to over ₹43,000!

The lesson? Start early and let your money work for you. Small contributions can lead to substantial growth over time.
